## Assignment Questions

1.
  a. Study of basic LINUX commands (refer Pdf for list of commands)
  b. Shell Programming (refer Pdf for list of experiments)
  c. Process System calls. {Orphan, Zombie, etc.}
  d. fork (), exit (), kill (), exec (), wait (), sleep () Programming

2. Write Script to see current date, time, username, and current directory
   
4. How to write shell script that will add two numbers, which are supplied as command line argument, and if this two numbers are not given show error and its usage.

5. Write Script to find out biggest number from given three nos. Numbers are supplied as commandline argument. Print error if sufficient arguments are not supplied.

6. Write script to print the following numbers as 5,4,3,2,1 using while loop.

7. Write Script, using case statement to perform basic math operation as follows: + addition, - subtraction, x multiplication, / division

8. Write script to print given number in reverse order, for eg. If no is 123 it must print as 321.

9. Write script to print given numbers sum of all digit, for eg. If no is 123 it's sum of all digit will be 1+2+3 = 6.

10. Write script to determine whether given file exist or not, file name is supplied as command line argument, also check for sufficient number of command line argument.

11. Write a shell script takes the name a path (eg: /afs/andrew/course/15/123/handin), and counts all the sub directories (recursively).

12. Write a shell script that takes a name of a folder as a command line argument, and produce a file that contains the names of all sub folders with size 0 (that is empty sub folders).

13. Write a shell script that takes a name of a folder, and delete all sub folders of size 0.

14. Write a shell script that will take an input file and remove identical lines (or duplicate lines from the file)

15. Process System calls

16.
   a. Implement process synchronization using semaphores.
   b. Simulation of Banker s algorithm to check whether the given system is in safe state or not. Also check whether addition resource requested can be granted immediately.

17. Implement a data parallelism using multi-threading.

18. Implement the below concepts:
    a) Dynamic memory allocation algorithms - First-fit, Best-fit, Worst- fit algorithms.
    b) Page Replacement Algorithms - FIFO, LRU and Optimal.

19. Detailed Study Report on Virtualization Setup: Type-1, Type-2 Hypervisor.
